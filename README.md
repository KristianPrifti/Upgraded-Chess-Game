Version 1.1
When you create a new ability make sure to create a script with its name in this format:
  If the ability is "Peasants Unite" the script file should be "Peasants Unite Script.gd" with that capitalization and spacing.
  It should be put on the "abilities_scripts" folder. 
  The script should extend "res://scripts/ability_in_shop.gd"
